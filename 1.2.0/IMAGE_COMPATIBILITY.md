## ✅ Best Images for Accurate Detection

### Recommended Image Types:

1. **✅ Living Rooms**
   - Good lighting (natural or artificial)
   - Clear furniture boundaries
   - Visible windows/doors
   - Well-framed shots

2. **✅ Bedrooms**
   - Bed, nightstand clearly visible
   - Windows/door visible
   - Good contrast between furniture and walls

3. **✅ Empty Rooms**
   - Manual furniture selection available
   - Clear architectural elements
   - Easy to optimize

### What Works Best:
- **Lighting**: Bright, even lighting
- **Angles**: Front-facing room view
- **Quality**: High resolution (at least 640x480)
- **Clarity**: Sharp focus, minimal blur
- **Contrast**: Clear furniture boundaries

## ⚠️ Images That May Have Issues

### Challenging Cases:

1. **Dark/Room Images**
   - Poor lighting affects detection
   - **Solution**: Increase brightness before upload

2. **Extreme Angles**
   - Top-down views may miss objects
   - **Solution**: Use front-facing room photos

3. **Cluttered Rooms**
   - Too many overlapping objects
   - **Solution**: Clean up before taking photo

4. **Low Quality**
   - Blurry or low-resolution images
   - **Solution**: Use at least HD quality
